# Computational Methods in the Study of Media:<br/> An Introductory Workshop And Research Symposium

Scholars and analysts of media, regardless of whether in advertising, journalism, or media studies, find themselves confronting a deluge of available (digital) data. We propose to organize a two-day workshop in introductory CSS which would introduce graduate students (both MA and Ph.D.), advanced undergraduates, and interested faculty in media on how to obtain, organize, and analyze commonly available data from online sources, on April 3-4, 2020.

Additionally, the program will feature a symposium where guest speakers will highlight issues about access, privacy, ethics, and confidentiality raised by the emergence of digital trace data and use of computational methods. The workshop will also serve as an opportunity for participants to network with scholars with similar substantive interests in media but expertise in computational methods.

The workshop and research symposium will take place in April 3-4, 2020 at Gregory Hall, located at 810 S Wright St, Urbana, IL 61801. Introductory Workshop will be held in Gregory Hall 123 and research symposium will be held in Gregory Hall 100.

## Introduction of Speakers 
### Michael Kearney

### Jennifer Pan http://jenpan.com/

Jennifer Pan is an Assistant Professor of Communication at Stanford University. Her research is at the intersection of political communication, computational social science, and authoritarian politics. Pan focuses on how autocrats control information to shape public preferences and behaviors in the digital age, using experimental and computational methods with large-scale datasets on political activity in China and other non-democratic regimes. Pan received her Ph.D. from Harvard Universityâ€™s Department of Government, and she received her A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.

### Jennifer Pan: How Saudi Crackdowns Fail to Silence Online Dissent

Saudi Arabia has imprisoned and tortured activists, religious leaders, and journalists for voicing dissent online. This reflects a growing worldwide trend in the use of physical repression to censor online speech. In this paper, we systematically examine the consequences of imprisoning well-known Saudis for online dissent by analyzing over 300 million tweets as well as detailed Google search data from 2010 to 2017 using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of content. We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent overall.
