# Computational Methods in the Study of Media: An Introductory Workshop And Research Symposium

Scholars and analysts of media, regardless of whether in advertising, journalism, or media studies, find themselves confronting a deluge of available (digital) data. We propose to organize a two-day workshop in introductory CSS which would introduce graduate students (both MA and Ph.D.), advanced undergraduates, and interested faculty in media on how to obtain, organize, and analyze commonly available data from online sources, on April 3-4, 2020.

Additionally, the program will feature a symposium where guest speakers will highlight issues about access, privacy, ethics, and confidentiality raised by the emergence of digital trace data and use of computational methods. The workshop will also serve as an opportunity for participants to network with scholars with similar substantive interests in media but expertise in computational methods.
