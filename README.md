# Computational Methods in the Study of Media:<br/> An Introductory Workshop And Research Symposium

How can scholars and analysts of media, make use of the massive available (digital) data? 
<br/>Our two-day workshop introduces methods of computational social science (CSS) on how to obtain, organize, and analyze commonly available data from online sources. 

A research symposium featuring leading communication scholars using computational methods accompanies the workshop.

### Intended Audience: Graduate Students (MA and PhD), Advanced Undergrduates and Interested Faculty. 
### Dates: April 3-4, 2020

Michael Kearney is an assistant professor at the University of Missouri where he holds a joint appointment in the School of Journalism and the Informatics Institute. His research examines the spread of political information through digital media using computational social scientific methods. Dr. Kearney teaches graduate courses in mass media theory, research methods, social media analytics, network analysis, and data science.

#### `Research Talk: Making Computational Methods Accessible for Communication Research: The Evolution of Open-Source R Packages` 

Recent advancements in computational social science have made it possible and easier than ever before to study *at-scale* how people interact and behave in digital spaces. Unfortunately, these advances in computational methods–many of which have been translated or demonstrated in social scientific contexts exclusively by computer scientists–remain largely inaccessible (or at the very least technically intimidating) to those who study media but otherwise lack computational backgrounds. With this in mind, I present the evolution of several open-source, user-friendly R packages I have designed specifically for mass communication and media researchers. These tools include {rtweet} (an R client for collecting and analyzing data from Twitter's APIs), {textfeatures} (a text processing package designed for machine learning workflows), and {tweetbotornot2} (a scalable, performant Twitter bot machine-learning classifier).

### Dr. Jennifer Pan [http://jenpan.com/](http://jenpan.com/)

<img align="left" width="260" src="https://comm.stanford.edu/mm/2014/10/JenPan.jpg"> 
Jennifer Pan is an Assistant Professor of Communication at Stanford University. Her research is at the intersection of political communication, computational social science, and authoritarian politics. Pan focuses on how autocrats control information to shape public preferences and behaviors in the digital age, using experimental and computational methods with large-scale datasets on political activity in China and other non-democratic regimes. Pan received her Ph.D. from Harvard University’s Department of Government, and she received her A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. 

#### `Research Talk: How Saudi Crackdowns Fail to Silence Online Dissent`

Saudi Arabia has imprisoned and tortured activists, religious leaders, and journalists for voicing dissent online. This reflects a growing worldwide trend in the use of physical repression to censor online speech. In this paper, we systematically examine the consequences of imprisoning well-known Saudis for online dissent by analyzing over 300 million tweets as well as detailed Google search data from 2010 to 2017 using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of content. We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent overall.

### Dr. Chris Vargo [http://chrisjvargo.com](http://chrisjvargo.com)
<img align="left" width="200" src="http://chrisjvargo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/CU-Headshot.jpg">
Chris J. Vargo is an assistant professor specializing in data analytics and digital advertising. Chris employs the use of computer science methods to investigate social media data using theories from communication, psychology and political science. Research methods of specialization include: data mining, machine learning, computer-assisted content analysis, data scraping, APIs, investigative statistics, prescriptive and predictive analytics, data forecasting, network analysis, Python, information retrieval and computer automation. Chris has three degrees in Advertising & Public Relations: a PhD from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, an MA from The University of Alabama and a BA from The Pennsylvania State University. 

#### `Research Talk: A Computational Case Study of Russian-Linked Facebook and Instagram Content`

This study examined political advertisements placed by the Russian-based Internet Research Agency on Facebook and Instagram. Advertisements were computationally analyzed for four rhetorical techniques presumed to elicit anger and fear: negative identity-based language, inflammatory language, obscene language, and threatening language. Congruent with extant research on arousing emotional responses, advertising clickthrough rates were positively associated with inflammatory, obscene, and threatening language. Surprisingly, however, a negative relationship between clickthrough rate and the use of negative identity-based language was observed. Additional analyses showed that the advertisements were engaged with at rates that exceed industry benchmarks, and that clickthrough rates increased over time.
